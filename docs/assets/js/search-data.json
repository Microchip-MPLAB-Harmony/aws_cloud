To the extent such modifications and derivatives do not qualify as a “work for hire,” Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, assigns and conveys the exclusive copyright thereof to Microchip, free and clear of any and all liens, claims or other encumbrances, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Licensee and Third Party use of such modifications and derivatives is limited to the license rights described in Section 1 above. . (b) Licensee shall have no right to sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the Software, Documentation or any related intellectual property rights except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. . | Termination of Agreement.

Further, Microchip may also terminate this Agreement upon reasonable belief that Licensee or Third Party have failed to comply with this Agreement. Upon termination, Licensee and Third Party will immediately stop using the Software, Documentation, and derivatives thereof, and immediately destroy all such copies, remove Software from any of Licensee’s tangible media and from systems on which the Software exists, and stop using, disclosing, copying, or reproducing Software (even as may be permitted by this Agreement). Termination of this Agreement will not affect the right of any end user or consumer to use Licensee Products or Third Party Products provided that such products were purchased prior to the termination of this Agreement. . | Dangerous Applications. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance (“Dangerous Applications”). Dangerous Applications include the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, weapons systems, or any environment or system in which the failure of the Software could lead directly or indirectly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

Cloning AWS_Cloud repo . To clone or download the repo from Github,go to the main page of this repository and then click Clone button to clone this repo or download as zip file. This content can also be download using content manager by following these instructions . This repo contains scripts needed to represent amazon-freertos as Harmony 3 component. It requires amazon-freertos repository to be cloned for code generation. . Cloning FreeRTOS (amazon-freertos) . This repo uses Git Submodules to bring in dependent components. . Note: If you download the ZIP file provided by GitHub UI or using content-manager, you will not get the contents of the submodules. (The ZIP file is also not a valid git repository) . To clone: . git clone https://github.com/MicrochipTech/amazon-freertos --recurse-submodules . If you have downloaded the repo without using the --recurse-submodules argument, you need to run: . git submodule update --init --recursive . Getting Started .

Folder Description . apps | Example applications for Amazon FreeRTOS | . config | Amazon FreeRTOS module configuration scripts | . doc | Images for Amazon FreeRTOS Component documentation | . docs | Amazon FreeRTOS help documentation | . templates | Configurations file templates | . Introduction . The Amazon FreeRTOS is abstracted as Harmony 3 component to easily configure and generate code to develop cloud connected applications using Harmony 3 framework. It uses updated version of Amazon FreeRTOS 202002.00 to support Microchip products for code generation. . Amazon FreeRTOS is now termed as FreeRTOS, but we still use the term Amazon FreeRTOS as the H3 component name to avoid confusion with existing H3 FreeRTOS (kernel) Component. . The Amazon FreeRTOS is supported in the following products. . SAM E70/S70/V70/V71 Family + ECC608 (Optional) | SAM D5x/E5x Family + ECC608 (Optional) + WINC1500/WINC3400 (Optional) | PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with Floating Point Unit (EF) Family + ECC608 (Optional) | . This repository contains following three components for configuration and code generation. . ##AmazonFreeRTOS Component Amazon FreeRTOS component is used to configure and generate Amazon FreeRTOS code, indepdent of any hardware configuration . . ##AmazonHWInterface component The Hardware interface components is used for device specific (E5x/D5x/E70/S70/V70/V71/PIC32MZEF) and Hardware specific (Ethernet/WIFI, NVM/ECC608) configuration and harcode generation. . . There are three configurations supported by this component . Wired Solution Only. | . This solution is available in all platforms. . Wired + ECC608 Solution | . This solution is available in all platforms. . WIFI Solution (WINC based solution can be WINC1500/WINC3400) | . This solution is available in SAMD5x/E5x platform only. . #AmazonDeviceTester component Amazon DeviceTester component is used to configure and generate code for qualification testing. It adds required dependencies for testing the Amazon FreeRTOS solution using Amazon IDT (refer: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/device-tester-for-freertos-ug.html). . . Important Licensing Information: For Amazon-FreeRTOS License, please refer to the license file under the amazon-freertos folder. . AWS Cloud Examples . The following applications are provided to demonstrate the AWS Cloud H3 Component . Name Description .
