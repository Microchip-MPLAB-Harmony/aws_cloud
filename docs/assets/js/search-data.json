    "content": "Note: OTA Guide on FreeRTOS can be found here for setting up and running the demo . The FreeRTOS OTA Solution requires a code-signing certificate with an ECDSA P-256 key and SHA-256 hash to perform OTA updates. Any image, which needs to be programmed needs to be signed by the private key generated using above step. The signed image is verified by the code signing certficate present in the hardware. FreeRTOS OTA also requires dual bank support of storing the running image and the new image to be flashed in different banks, so that at any point of time there is one valid image available. As part of the above step, we import the code-signing certificate, private key, and certificate chain into AWS Certificate Manager. This ensures the FreeRTOS OTA Job to sign the firmware image used in Amazon S3 buckets with the private key. | The bootloader is a Fail-Safe secure bootloader, which verfies the Application image stored in the each bank with the ECDSA/SHA-256 signature stored in the bank’s descriptor. The bootloader uses the code signing certficate generated earlier and stored in th flash. | The Application image is a FreeRTOS based application which uses FreeRTOS OTA to perform a live firmware update into the higher bank. | The Descriptor maintains the status of the Application image stored (i.e. image flags, image signature, size,etc). | . Note: The initial image that needs to be programmed is a factory image. The factory Application image needs to be signed by the OEM for the first time, following which users needs to upload unsigned firmware image into Amazon S3 buckets and follow the FreeRTOS OTA guide to perform OTA Update.

This content can also be download using content manager by following these instructions This repo contains scripts needed to represent [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/amazon-freertos) as Harmony 3 component. It requires [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/amazon-freertos) repository to be cloned for code generation. ## Cloning FreeRTOS. This repo uses [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to bring in dependent components. Note: If you download the ZIP file provided by GitHub UI or using content-manager, you will not get the contents of the submodules. (The ZIP file is also not a valid git repository) To clone: ``` git clone https://github.com/MicrochipTech/amazon-freertos ``` # Getting Started For more information on FreeRTOS and provisoning of secure element, refer to the [Getting Started guide of different boards](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/amazon-freertos/tree/mchpdev/vendors/microchip/boards). ## Introduction The FreeRTOS is abstracted as Harmony 3 component to easily configure and generate code to develop cloud connected applications using Harmony 3 framework. It uses updated version of FreeRTOS 202002.00 to support Microchip products for code generation. Amazon FreeRTOS is now termed as FreeRTOS, but we still use the term Amazon FreeRTOS as the H3 component name to avoid confusion with existing H3 FreeRTOS (kernel) Component. FreeRTOS is supported in the following products. - SAM E70/S70/V70/V71 Family + + ECC608 (Optional) + WINC1500/WINC3400 (Optional) - SAM D5x/E5x Family + ECC608 (Optional) + WINC1500/WINC3400 (Optional) - PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with Floating Point Unit (EF) Family + ECC608 (Optional) + WINC1500/WINC3400 (Optional) - SAM G55 Family + ECC608 + WINC1500/WINC3400. This repository contains following three components for configuration and code generation. ## AmazonFreeRTOS Component Amazon FreeRTOS component is used to configure and generate FreeRTOS code, indepdent of any hardware configuration ![Things Screen](/aws_cloud/doc/images/H3_Component_1.png) ## AmazonHWInterface component The Hardware interface component is used to abstract device, interface and key storage configuration and code generation. ![Things Screen](/aws_cloud/doc/images/H3_Component_2.png) There are three configurations supported by this component 1. Wired Solution Only. ![Things Screen](/aws_cloud/doc/images/image0.png) This solution is available in all platforms which supports wired connectvity (except SAMG55). 2. Wired + ECC608 Solution ![Things Screen](/aws_cloud/doc/images/image1.png) This solution is available in all platforms which supports wired connectvity (except SAMG55). 3. WIFI Solution (WINC based solution can be WINC1500/WINC3400) ![Things Screen](/aws_cloud/doc/images/image2.png) This solution is available in all platforms supported.. ## AmazonDeviceTester component Amazon DeviceTester component is used to configure and generate code for qualification testing. It adds required dependencies for testing the Amazon FreeRTOS solution using Amazon IDT (refer: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/device-tester-for-freertos-ug.html). ![Things Screen](/aws_cloud/doc/images/H3_Component_3.png) Important Licensing Information: For FreeRTOS License, please refer to the license file in the [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/amazon-freertos/tree/mchpdev) repository. ## AWS Cloud Examples The following applications are provided to demonstrate the AWS Cloud H3 Component | Name | Description | -------- | ----------- | [LED Shadow Client](/aws_cloud/apps/led_shadow_client_ecc/readme.html) | This example application shows how to use the Shadow client feature to set/clear device status using LED(s) using ECC608 | [OTA Update Demo](/aws_cloud/apps/ota_update_demo/readme.html) | This example application demonstrates the usage of OTA feature to update a new image on SAME54 XPRO + WINC1500. | ____ [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Harmony%20license-orange.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud/blob/master/mplab_harmony_license.md) [![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud/releases/latest) [![Latest release date](https://img.shields.io/github/release-date/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud/releases/latest) [![Commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud/graphs/commit-activity) [![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors-anon/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud.svg)]() ____ [![Follow us on Youtube](https://img.shields.io/badge/Youtube-Follow%20us%20on%20Youtube-red.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/user/MicrochipTechnology) [![Follow us on LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Follow%20us%20on%20LinkedIn-blue.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microchip-technology) [![Follow us on Facebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Facebook-Follow%20us%20on%20Facebook-blue.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/microchiptechnology/) [![Follow us on Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/MicrochipTech.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/MicrochipTech) [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud.svg?style=social)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/github/watchers/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/aws_cloud.svg?style=social)]() ",
